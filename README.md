🚦 Smart Traffic Signal System
A comprehensive AI-powered traffic management solution that leverages computer vision, machine learning, and real-time data processing to dynamically control traffic flow, detect emergency vehicles, and ensure road safety through a unified web interface.

📌 Overview
The Smart Traffic Signal system is designed to automate and optimize traffic signal control by analyzing real-time traffic density and giving priority to emergency vehicles such as ambulances. It consists of multiple integrated components that work together to provide an intelligent and responsive traffic control infrastructure.

🧩 Components
1. Traffic Signal Control System
Core control logic for signal operations

Real-time analysis of traffic density

Adaptive signal timing based on congestion levels

2. Vehicle Detection Module
Vehicle detection, counting, and classification using computer vision

Traffic density estimation using live feed analysis

Generates input for traffic signal controller

3. Emergency Vehicle Detection (Ambulance)
Detection and tracking of emergency vehicles (ambulances)

Automatically overrides standard signal patterns to prioritize emergency response

Sends real-time alerts to the control system and web dashboard

4. Web Dashboard - Road Safety Interface
Real-time visualization of traffic data

Signal states and alerts for emergency vehicles

Interactive analytics dashboard for performance monitoring

5. Traffic Management System
Centralized system to manage, analyze, and report traffic data

Facilitates smooth flow coordination across intersections

Stores historical data for analysis and optimization

🚀 Usage
Vehicle Detection: Run the vehicle detection module with a connected camera or video feed.

Traffic Signal Control: The controller script dynamically adjusts signal timings based on input from the vehicle detection module.

Ambulance Detection: Emergency vehicles are prioritized when detected by the system.

Web Dashboard: Launch the dashboard to monitor real-time status and analytics.

Detailed setup and usage for each module can be found in their respective folders.
