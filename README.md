# üö¶ Smart Traffic Signal System

A comprehensive AI-powered traffic management solution that leverages **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **real-time data processing** to dynamically control traffic flow, detect emergency vehicles, and ensure road safety through a unified web interface.

---

## üìå Overview

The **Smart Traffic Signal** system is designed to automate and optimize traffic signal control by analyzing real-time traffic density and giving priority to emergency vehicles such as ambulances. It consists of multiple integrated components that work together to provide an intelligent and responsive traffic control infrastructure.

## üß© Components

### 1. **Traffic Signal Control System**
- Core control logic for signal operations
- Real-time analysis of traffic density
- Adaptive signal timing based on congestion levels

### 2. **Vehicle Detection Module**
- Vehicle detection, counting, and classification using computer vision
- Traffic density estimation using live feed analysis
- Generates input for traffic signal controller

### 3. **Emergency Vehicle Detection (Ambulance)**
- Detection and tracking of emergency vehicles (ambulances)
- Automatically overrides standard signal patterns to prioritize emergency response
- Sends real-time alerts to the control system and web dashboard

### 4. **Web Dashboard - Road Safety Interface**
- Real-time visualization of traffic data
- Signal states and alerts for emergency vehicles
- Interactive analytics dashboard for performance monitoring

### 5. **Traffic Management System**
- Centralized system to manage, analyze, and report traffic data
- Facilitates smooth flow coordination across intersections
- Stores historical data for analysis and optimization
